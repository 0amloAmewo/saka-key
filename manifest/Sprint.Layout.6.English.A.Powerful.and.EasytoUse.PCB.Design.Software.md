## What is Sprint Layout 6 English?
 
Sprint Layout 6 English is a software program developed by ABACOM, a German company specialized in electronic software. It allows you to design and edit single-sided, double-sided, or multilayer PCB layouts with ease and flexibility. You can place pads, tracks, zones, text-labels, and other components wherever you want, without any limitations or restrictions. You can also import and export Gerber files, which are the standard format for PCB manufacturing. Sprint Layout 6 English supports Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 operating systems.
 
## What are the main features of Sprint Layout 6 English?
 
Sprint Layout 6 English comes packed with a wide range of features and tools for creating board designs. Some of the most important ones are:
 
- **Extensive component library:** Sprint Layout 6 English has a large library of predefined components for SMD (Surface Mount Device) layouts. You can also create your own custom components with the Footprint-Wizard, which lets you specify the footprint-type and parameters.
- **Multilayer support:** Sprint Layout 6 English can handle up to six layers of PCBs. You can easily switch between layers, adjust their colors and visibility, and assign different functions to them.
- **Automatic ground plane:** This feature helps you create a screen for HF (High Frequency) boards by filling unused areas of a layout with copper automatically. This reduces noise and interference on your circuits.
- **Design-Rule-Check:** This feature checks your layout for errors and violations of common design rules. It can detect short circuits, overlapping tracks, missing connections, and other issues that may affect the functionality of your PCB.
- **Point-To-Point Autorouter:** This feature automatically connects pads with tracks according to your specifications. You can set the routing mode, direction, clearance, width, and layer for each connection.
- **Components list:** This feature generates a list of all components used in your layout. You can export this list as a text file or a CSV file for further processing.
- **Pick+Place export:** This feature exports the coordinates and orientations of all components in your layout as a text file or a CSV file. This file can be used by pick-and-place machines for automated assembly of your PCBs.
- **HPGL isolation milling:** This feature creates HPGL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language) files for isolation milling of your PCBs. If you have a CNC (Computer Numerical Control) milling machine, you can use these files to cut out your PCBs from copper-clad boards.
