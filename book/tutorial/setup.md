# Setup

Complete the following steps to ensure an optimal experience using Saka Key.

1. **Install Saka Key**

  If you're viewing this page, you probably  have Saka key installed. If not, follow the [installation instructions](/getting_started/install.md).

2. **Switch to Power Command Profile**

  If you aren't afraid of accidentally closing a tab or refreshing the page, [change your profile](./settings.md) for Command mode  to `power`. This will enable faster, easier to type keyboard shortcuts.

3. **Enable Saka Key on File URLs**

  1. Navigate to Chrome's Extensions Page by following either step a or b below

    a. Enter `chrome://extensions` into your URL bar and hit Enter
    
    b. In Chrome's toolbar dropdown menu, select `More Tools` then select `Extensions`

  2. Find Saka Key in the list of installed Extensions and enable the checkbox that says `Allow access to file URLs`
