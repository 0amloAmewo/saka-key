# Saka Key

A keyboard interface to the web. Twin to [Saka](https://github.com/lusakasa/saka) - a voice interface to the web.

Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/saka-key/hhhpdkekipnbloiiiiaokibebpdpakdp).

## Intro

Saka Key lets you navigate the web with just your keyboard. It differs from existing vi-inspired chrome extensions on two fronts:

1. Its primary focus is ease of use. It's not targeted to developers. Aesthetics matter and graphical menus takes preference over text configuration.

2. Its code is clean and organized to make it easy to understand and contribute to. It's engineered, not hacked together. 

## Development

```
npm install
npm run build
```
