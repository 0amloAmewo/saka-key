# Saka Key

A keyboard interface to the web. Twin to [Saka](https://github.com/lusakasa/saka) - a voice interface to the web.

## Intro

SakaVim is inspired and partially derived from [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) and other similar existing extensions. It differs on two fronts:
1. Its primary focus is ease of use. It's not targeted to developers.
2. Its code is clean and organized to make it easy to understand and contribute to.

## Development

```
npm install
npm run build
```
