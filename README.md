# Saka Key

Saka Key is a Chrome and Firefox extension for keyboard-only web browsing. It's configurable, easy to use, and engineered thoughtfully. Install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/saka-key/hhhpdkekipnbloiiiiaokibebpdpakdp) or the [Firefox Marketplace](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saka-key/). Also read the [Saka Key Handbook](https://key.saka.io) and try the accompanying tab search extension [Saka](https://github.com/lusakasa/saka).
