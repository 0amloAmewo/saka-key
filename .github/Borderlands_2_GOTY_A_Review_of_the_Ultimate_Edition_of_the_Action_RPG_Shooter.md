## Tips and Tricks
 
Borderlands 2 GOTY is a game that rewards exploration, experimentation, and creativity. Here are some tips and tricks on how to get the most out of the game:

- Try different combinations of weapons, items, skills, and perks to find what suits your playstyle best. You can also respec your skills at any time for a small fee if you want to try something new.
- Use elemental weapons to exploit the weaknesses of your enemies. Fire weapons are effective against flesh enemies, corrosive weapons are effective against armored enemies, shock weapons are effective against shielded enemies, slag weapons are effective against all enemies but especially useful in higher difficulties, and explosive weapons are effective against most enemies but have limited ammo.
- Use cover and movement to avoid taking damage from enemy fire. You can also use your action skill to gain an advantage in combat. Each class has a unique action skill that can be activated once it is fully charged. For example, the Gunzerker can dual-wield any two weapons for a limited time, the Siren can phase-lock an enemy or ally for various effects depending on her skill tree,
- the Commando can deploy a turret that shoots enemies automatically,
- the Assassin can turn invisible and deal massive damage with his melee attack,
- the Mechromancer can summon a robot called Deathtrap that fights alongside her,
- and the Psycho can enter a berserk mode that increases his melee damage and health regeneration.
- Loot everything you can find in the game. You will find chests, lockers, crates, vending machines, piles of junk, corpses, toilets, mailboxes, and more that contain weapons, items, money,
Eridium,
and other goodies.
You can also sell or trade your unwanted loot for better ones or for cash.
- Complete side quests to gain extra experience points,
money,
items,
and rewards.
