[Saka Key](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/saka-key/hhhpdkekipnbloiiiiaokibebpdpakdp) lets you control your browser with keyboard commands. It is easy-to-use, highly configurable, and will transform how you surf the web. Put away your mouse. With Saka Key, you can:

* click links
* scroll and zoom the page
* switch, close, and rearrange tabs
* and much more...

## Motivation

> The power of the Web is in its universality.
Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.

> Tim Berners-Lee,
Inventor of the World Wide Web

When the web isn't accessible, it's because people who author content don't benefit from making it accessible. Saka Key leverages accessibility information to make the browsing experience better for *everyone*. I hope this will encourage the creation of accessible content.

Keyboard commands are only the beginning of this journey. Screen reading and voice commands are on the roadmap.
